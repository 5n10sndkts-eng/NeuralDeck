# 🚀 PROTOCOL: ASCENSION
## MISSION: Backend Hardening & Production Deployment
**Target System:** NeuralDeck Core (v2.0)
**Authorization:** Clearance Level 5 (God Mode)

### // THE OBJECTIVE
The interface is live. The agents are awake. The visual cortex (frontend) is online. Now, we sever the tether to localhost. We must calcify the **Node.js backend**, erect **Cyber-Security defenses**, and containerize the neural network for **global distribution**.

### // THE SQUADRON
For this final push, **The Council** delegates authority to:
*   **📦 The Operator (DevOps):** To containerize the soul of the machine.
*   **🛡️ Sentinel (SecOps):** To erect firewalls and sanitize inputs.
*   **🏗️ The Architect (Backend):** To optimize the Express gateway for high-throughput concurrency.

---

### // UPGRADE SPECIFICATIONS

#### 1. THE CORE REINFORCEMENT (Backend Optimization)
We will not just run; we will *fly*.
*   **PM2 Process Management:** No more `node server.js`. We implement process clustering to utilize every CPU core available.
*   **Rate Limiting Throttles:** Prevent neural overload (DDoS) by implementing `express-rate-limit`.
*   **Compression Streams:** Gzip all neural data for lightning-fast latency.
*   **Robust Error Handling:** A unified error boundary that catches crashes before they kill the server.

#### 2. SENTINEL DEFENSE MATRIX (Security)
The Grid is dangerous. We need armor.
*   **Helmet.js Integration:** Secure HTTP headers to prevent XSS and clickjacking.
*   **Input Sanitization:** Neutralize command injection attacks in the `shell_exec` modules.
*   **CORS Lockdown:** Restrict API access to authorized domains only.
*   **Environment Isolation:** Transition hardcoded secrets to a strict `.env.production` vault.

#### 3. CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS (Dockerization)
Code once, run anywhere.
*   **Multi-Stage Docker Build:** A lean, production-ready image (<100MB) that builds the React frontend and serves it via Nginx.
*   **Nginx Reverse Proxy:** A battle-tested web server to sit in front of the Node API, handling SSL and static assets.
*   **Docker Compose v3:** One command (`docker-compose up -d`) to spin up the entire neural stack (Frontend + Backend + Vector DB).

#### 4. THE LAUNCH BUTTON (Scripts)
*   **`npm run deploy`**: A single command to build, containerize, and launch.
*   **Health Checks**: Automated endpoints (`/health`) to verify system integrity.

### // USER INSTRUCTION
**"To initiate Phase Omega, simply command the AI:"**

> *"Activate The Operator. I want to convert NeuralDeck from a development prototype into a production-ready artifact. Harden the server.js with Helmet and Rate Limiting. create a multi-stage Dockerfile that serves the frontend via Nginx and proxies the backend. Generate a docker-compose.yml for the full stack. We are going live."*

**STATUS:** AWAITING COMMAND...
**SYSTEM:** READY.
