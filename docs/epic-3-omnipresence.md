# Epic 3: Omnipresence

## Vision Statement

**"NeuralDeck becomes an extension of the developer's mind - controlled by voice, fed by visual mockups, wrapped in generative ambient soundscapes."**

This epic transforms NeuralDeck from a visual tool into a **multi-sensory AI workstation** that responds to natural human input modalities.

---

## Business Value

**Problem:** Developers are limited to keyboard/mouse interaction, creating friction in creative flow states.

**Solution:** Voice commands for hands-free control, drag-drop UI generation from mockups, ambient audio for enhanced focus.

**Impact:**
- 40% faster workflow execution (voice > typing)
- Visual prototyping without code
- Enhanced developer experience with sonic ambience

**Target Users:**
- Developers in flow state who don't want to break focus
- Designers who want instant prototypes from mockups
- Power users who prefer voice interfaces
